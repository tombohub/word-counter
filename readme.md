### Idea: Word Count

Create a simple command-line tool that takes a text file as input and outputs the number of words in the file.

#### Requirements:

1. **Input:**

   - The tool should take a text file as a command-line argument.

2. **Processing:**

   - Count the number of words in the file. Consider a word as any sequence of characters separated by whitespace.

3. **Output:**
   - Display the total number of words in the file.

#### Example Usage:

```bash
# Using the tool in different languages
# Example in Python
python word_count.py input.txt

# Example in JavaScript (Node.js)
node word_count.js input.txt

# Example in Ruby
ruby word_count.rb input.txt

# Example in Go
go run word_count.go input.txt

# Example in C++
./word_count_cpp input.txt
```

#### Tips:

- Keep the tool simple, focusing on the core functionality of counting words.
- Consider handling errors, such as when the file does not exist or when there are issues reading the file.
- Write the tool in multiple languages to compare and contrast the implementations.

This project allows you to explore file I/O, command-line argument handling, string manipulation, and basic program structure in different programming languages. It's a great way to gain familiarity with the syntax and features of various languages while working on a practical task.
